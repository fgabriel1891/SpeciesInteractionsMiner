## Welcome to SpIn: Species Interactions Miner

 > This is a shiny app to facilitate the mining of pairwise species interactions from literature. 
 
 
# How to use it:

 1.- Select and upload one or more literature works as PDF (articles, books, thesis, etc) to search for species interactions occurrences within the text. 
 
 2.- From the dropdown list, select a dictionary describing the interaction of interest. 
 
 3.- Select the article of interest and Hit the "Explore" button to start looking for species interactions occurrences. ( This might take a bit of time depending of the lenght of the text uploaded) 
 
 4.- An interactive plot, showing the species scientific names and dictionary matches found within the text. 
 
 5.- Explore the interactive plot, zoom in to certain areas and hover your mouse over the points for more information. The x-axis represents the lenght of the text (in characters). The y-axis represents the logarithm of the pairwise distance between adjacent text hits. 
 
 6.- Mentions of species interactions occurrences are likely to occur where clusters of species and dictionary (actions + descriptors) are formed. Cluster of species names may usually shows because of tables. Zoom in and with the slider tool render the piece of text for more information. 
 
 7.- Fill in the dataset below with your interactions mined. 
 
 8.- At the "Download tab you can download your dataset as a .csv file for further analisis"
 
 9.- (Optional) Visualize your results as a network!
